This website is intended to described some of my personal R projects. It may include some posts on other general subjects.

This is my first attempt to use the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package
to setup and maintain a website via [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/) and available
via [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/). This site uses the [Hyde theme](http://themes.gohugo.io/hyde/) in Hugo.

To get started, I first looked at a [post by Amber Thomas](https://proquestionasker.github.io/blog/Making_Site/). I did not
follow her steps very closely. Instead, I aimed to rely more on the
RStudio side of things than on GitHub. Based on the items in the comment
thread by blogdown's creator Yihui Xie, I decided to rely on two
repositories. One for the raw material for the web site and then
johngoldin.github.io to contain the static website created by Hugo.
Amber's instructions involve creating two branches in the johngoldin.github.io repository.
That sounded too complicated.

Previously I did some [posts on WordPress](https://caniblogtoo.wordpress.com/) and before that
I did some on [Blogger](http://goldinoldie.blogspot.com/).
